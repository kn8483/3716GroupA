End of iteration 1. 

We have an implementation of the most basic grouping algorithm, a running interface, and a code framework into which we can add the rest of our functionality.

Revised goals for features to be added by end of project:
- Professor can specify mandatory and forbidden partners
- Groups can be be balanced by GPA/Score
- Professor can choose some parameters for how to group students (whether or not to balance GPA, how to deal with indivisibility, etc.) 
- Extra (time permitting) - manual editing of groups by swapping
