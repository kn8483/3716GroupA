"classlist_COMP3715.bin" and "classlist_COMP3716.bin" MUST BE IN THIS DIRECTORY when you run the project. 
(They contain the serialized ArrayLists of Student objects.) 

The output text files "COMP3715_Groups.txt" and "COMP3716_Groups.txt" will also be created in this directory.

Just double-click on the jar file, or type "java -jar ProfGrouping.jar"
